This project is allows you to see sorting in real-time based on the current implemented algorithms:

Everytime the graph has been sorted, you can click "Generate new Graph" to reset it, and choose another algorithm. Furthermore, thse graph can also be sorted in both ascending and descending order! More algorithm will be implemeted at a later date!
